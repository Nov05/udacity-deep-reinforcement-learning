1. For this toy game, two `Deep Q-network` methods are tried out. Since the observations (states) are simple (not in pixels), convolutional layers are not in use. And the evaluation results confirm that linear layers are sufficient for solving the problem.   
	* **Double DQN**, with 3 linear layers (hidden dims: 256\*64, later tried with 64\*64)  
	* **Dueling DQN**, with 2 linear layers + 2 split linear layers (hidden dims: 64\*64)  

‚ñ™Ô∏è The Dueling DQN architecture is displayed as below.

‚ñ™Ô∏è Since both the advantage and the value stream propagate gradients to the last convolutional layer in the backward pass, we rescale the combined gradient entering the last convolutional layer by 1/‚àö2. This simple heuristic mildly increases stability.

```Python
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(state_size, 64)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.layer3_adv = nn.Linear(in_features=64, out_features=action_size) ## advantage
        self.layer3_val = nn.Linear(in_features=64, out_features=1) ## state value

    def forward(self, state):
        x = F.relu(self.layer1(state))
        x = F.relu(self.layer2(x))
        adv, val = self.layer3_adv(x), self.layer3_val(x)
        return (val + adv - adv.mean(1).unsqueeze(1).expand(x.size(0), action_size)) / (2**0.5)
```  

‚ñ™Ô∏è In addition, we clip the gradients to have their norm less than or equal to 10. This clipping is not standard practice in deep RL, but common in recurrent network training (Bengio et al., 2013).

```Python 
        ## clip the gradients
        nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(self.qnetwork_local.parameters(), 10.)
        nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(self.qnetwork_target.parameters(), 10.) 
```

2. The following picture shows the train and eval scores (rewards) for both architectures. Since it is a toy project, trained models are not formally evaluated. We can roughly see that Dueling DQN slightly performs better with **an average score of 17** vs. Double DQN 13 in 10 episodes.
